The lab has been devoted to developing novel natural language processing (NLP) methods, software, and applications for diverse biomedical texts, such as clinical notes, biomedical literature, and social media. These three areas complement each other: new methods lead to software that are used by many researchers, software facilitates clinical applications, and successful applications reveal where there is need for new methods, closing the loop and forming an ecosystem of our research activities in clinical NLP.
